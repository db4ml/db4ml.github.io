# CS-A1155: Databases for Data Science

This repository contains materials for the course **CS-A1155: Databases for Data Science** at Aalto University.

A central theme of the course is the **relational data model**, which provides a precise framework for 
defining and reasoning about datasets. These datasets are essential for training and validating AI 
systems.

Datasets consist of data points, which are objects that carry information. For example, a real-world dataset 
could be a herd of cows:

![Cows in the Swiss Alps](./assets/Cows_in_the_Swiss_Alps.jpg)

We can access the information carried by these data points (cows) in different ways, such as measuring their 
weight and height or placing a [sensor in their stomach](https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/422078-trust-your-gut-a-stomach-based-sensor-to-monitor-cow-health).

However, directly working with such datasets can be impractical. Instead, we use a **data model** to approximate 
real-world datasets. One example of such a model is the **relational data model**, which revolves around the 
concept of a **relation (or table)** at its core.
