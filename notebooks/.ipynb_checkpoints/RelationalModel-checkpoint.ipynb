    "## Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "A **relation** (or table) is formally defined as a **set of tuples** (or rows) with attributes (columns). We denote a relation as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R(A_1: T_1, A_2: T_2, ..., A_n: T_n) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ R $ is the **name** of the relation (table)\n",
    "- $ A_1, A_2, ..., A_n $ are **attributes** (columns) of the relation\n",
    "- $ T_1, T_2, ..., T_n $ are the corresponding **domains** or **data types** of the attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a relation representing information about Students:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Students(sid: INTEGER, name: STRING, major: STRING, year: INTEGER) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $ sid: INTEGER $ – the **student ID** (Primary Key)\n",
    "- $ name: STRING $ – stores the student’s **name**\n",
    "- $ major: STRING $ – stores the student’s **field of study**\n",
    "- $ year: INTEGER $ – represents the student’s **expected graduation year**\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Tuples and Attribute Values\n",
    "\n",
    "A **tuple** $t$ is a single entry (or row) in a relation $R$. Each tuple consists of **attribute values** corresponding to the attributes of the relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a relation $R$ has attributes $ \\{ A_1, A_2, ..., A_n \\} $, then a tuple $ t $ in $ R $ is represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "t = (v_1, v_2, ..., v_n)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $ v_i = t[A_i] $ is the value of attribute $ A_i $ in the tuple $ t $. \n",
    "\n",
    "To build intuition, it is useful to think of a relation $R$ as a two-dimensional table with cells containing data. The name of the table corresponds to the name of the relation, the columns of the table represent the attributes and the rows of the table represent the tuples. **Note: Relations are a special type of tables in the sense that the order of the rows is irrelevant.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example.\n",
    "Given the `Students` relation, an example set of tuples could be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "    t_1 &= (1, \\text{``Alice''}, \\text{``Computer Science''}, 2024) \\\\\n",
    "    t_2 &= (2, \\text{``Bob''}, \\text{``Mathematics''}, 2025)\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For tuple $ t_1 $:\n",
    "- $t_1[sid] = 1$\n",
    "- $t_1[name] = \\text{``Alice''}$\n",
    "- $t_1[major] = \\text{``Computer Science''}$\n",
    "- $t_1[year] = 2024$\n",
    "- A **subtuple** of $t_1$ on, say, $(sid, major)$ would be $t_1[sid, major] = (1, \\text{``Computer Science''})$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each tuple represents a unique entity (a student in this case) and stores specific values for its attributes. Each of these values must belong to the domain of the corresponding attribute, e.g., the value $t_1[major]$ must belong to the domain $STRING$.\n",

A **relation instance** represents the specific set of tuples currently stored in a relation at a particular moment in time. You could think of an instance as a snapshot of the dataset represented by a relation. \n",

    "**Relational algebra** is a formal language that allows to construct new relations from existing ones through a set of fundamental operations. We can think of these new relations as \"answers\" to database queries which are formulated as algebraic expressions. Just like arithmetic algebra uses operands (variables and constants) and operators (e.g., addition, multiplication) to produce new numerical expressions, relational algebra constructs new relations from existing ones using relational operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational algebra serves as the theoretical foundation for SQL and other query languages, providing a formal method for precisely defining database queries and transformations. Understanding relational algebra is beneficial not only because of its theoretical clarity, but also because it provides valuable intuition for mastering SQL and other database query languages built upon the relational model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider relational algebra and SQL as related yet distinct languages—similar to how German and Dutch are closely related. Both German and Dutch share common roots, structure, and vocabulary, allowing speakers of one to understand much of the other. Likewise, relational algebra and SQL express similar operations and logic for querying databases, yet differ in syntax and style. Relational algebra is more formal, concise, while SQL offers a somewhat more verbose and ``user-friendly'' query writing and execution.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\rho_{\\,T(a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n)}(R)\n",

    "1. Rename the **relation** $R$ to **$T$**,\n",
    "2. Rename the **attributes** of $R$ to $a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$ (in order).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is useful for:\n",
    "- Avoiding **name conflicts**, e.g., when two relations use attributes that have the same name but different meanings.\n",
    "- Improving **readability** of complex expressions (e.g., giving short relation names).\n",
